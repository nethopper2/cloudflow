# Spinnaker Operator Installation

Followed Spinnakeri's *Quick Start* section from it's GitHub [README](https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-operator/blob/master/README.md). Only difference is to deploy the operator from the *deploy/operator/basic* directory instead of *deploy/operator/cluster*.

Created KAOPS apps for the *crds* and *deploy* folders. Set deploy app namespace to *spinnaker-operator* and enable auto-create namespace when creating the app in KAOPS.
